    <h1>Qubiq Solutions</h1>
    <p>Because execution &gt; meetings.</p>

    <h2>What is Qubiq Solutions?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s a business. It’s an experiment. It’s a rapid iteration engine disguised as a company.
      If you’re expecting case studies, a 20-page “Our Services” PDF, and a team of suits nodding in unison—wrong place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in execution over bureaucracy, prototypes over pitch decks, and actually building instead of just talking about building.
      No corporate fluff, just ideas → execution → results.
    </p>

    <h2>AI First, Human Approved</h2>
    <p>
      AI isn’t the future—it’s now. Instead of thought leadership and buzzwords, I use AI for everything.
      The name Qubiq Solutions? AI-generated. Wrote a Python script, checked domain availability, and boom—Qubiq it is.
      The logo? Doesn’t exist. Priorities, my friend.
      The business model? Find problems, build fast, iterate even faster.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Am I? (And Why Should You Care?)</h2>
    <p>
      15+ years in tech—started as a dev, became a PM, then a product owner, then head of ops.
      Built and launched multiple products—from idea to exit.
      Left the corporate slog to launch my own AI-driven SaaS.
    </p>

    <h2>What Am I Doing Now?</h2>
    <p>
      Building AI-powered micro SaaS products for niche problems.
      Helping select clients launch and scale their products (if they get my style).
      Actively looking for inefficiencies where AI can make a real impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
    <p>
      No fluff. No layers of managers. No “let’s circle back next week.”
      If I take on your project, I treat it like my own startup.
      AI-first mindset—no manual slogging where automation can win.
    </p>
